### What I learned

For this project, I used Sass to write modular and reusable CSS code. I followed the mobile-first approach and utilized flexbox to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Additionally, I practiced using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention to improve the maintainability of my code. Overall, this project allowed me to hone my skills in Sass, responsive design, and naming conventions.
